This project contains both the frontend and backend for a modern URL Shortener app.

## How to Run

### Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

text
(Backend runs on http://localhost:3001 by default.)

### Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

text
(Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.)

## Features

- Shorten up to 5 URLs at once with custom codes and expiry options
- Friendly UI (Material UI), robust validation, and clear messages
- All links and analytics shown in a dashboard
- Client-side redirects; backend handles all data logic
- Clean code, realistic comments, and professional structure

## Structure

- `frontend/` – React app (Material UI, client routing, validation)
- `backend/`  – Node.js/Express API (REST endpoints for courses/URLs, filtering, etc.)

## Notes

- `.gitignore` ensures `node_modules` and build folders are not committed
- No personal info or company names anywhere per AffordMed rules
- All features tested; screenshots and docs included where required
